# Firment
An opinionated firmware framework that uses web interfaces to ease development and testing.

## Guiding Principles
- GUIs are important, firmware customers need something graphical.
- Use web interface(s) instead of native GUIs.
- Make a reasonable effort to containerize tools.
- Be declarative about messages, let message-handling code be generated.
